# Decision tree
The decision tree algorithm takes in a node class, which contains training data as an argument. `TreeGrowth` recursively finds the optimal split between the dataset according to either weighted Gini index or entropy ratio. In each recursive step, the two subsets from the best split are then assigned as the children to that node.
